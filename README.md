## 📊 DataCamp Project-Based Learning Repository

Welcome to my repository showcasing projects completed through DataCamp's project-based learning courses. This repository features a collection of real-world projects that I undertook as part of my DataCamp learning journey. These projects cover various aspects of data science, including data analysis, machine learning, and visualization, and are designed to demonstrate practical applications of the skills and concepts acquired during my studies.

### 📁 Contents

- **Project 1: [Insurance Claims Prediction](https://github.com/victorlcastro-dsa/PBL_DataCamp/blob/07fcda7f6797036a5ba51be93d8dbba0469ef752/modeling_car_insurance_claim_outcomes/workspace/notebook.ipynb)**  
  A machine learning project focused on predicting whether a customer will make a claim on their car insurance during the policy period. Key techniques used include data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection to optimize accuracy.

- **Project 2: [Predictive Modeling for Agriculture](https://github.com/victorlcastro-dsa/PBL_DataCamp/blob/d354bf4fffc5bd58cc1b041e934dd6a4ef481dbb/workspaces/predictive_modeling_for_agriculture/workspace/notebook.ipynb)**  
  A machine learning project aimed at assisting farmers in selecting the optimal crop for their field using supervised learning and feature selection techniques. The challenge involves addressing a budget constraint where only one of four critical soil measures can be assessed: Nitrogen, Phosphorous, Potassium, or pH value. The goal is to identify the most influential feature for accurate crop prediction, demonstrating the application of feature selection in a real-world agricultural context.
