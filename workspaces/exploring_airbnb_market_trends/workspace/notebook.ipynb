There are many Airbnb listings in New York City to meet the high demand for temporary lodging for travelers, which can be anywhere between a few nights to many months. In this project, we will take a closer look at the New York Airbnb market by combining data from multiple file types like `.csv`, `.tsv`, and `.xlsx`.\n","\n","Recall that **CSV**, **TSV**, and **Excel** files are three common formats for storing data. \n","Three files containing data on 2019 Airbnb listings are available to you:\n","\n","**data/airbnb_price.csv**\n","This is a CSV file containing data on Airbnb listing prices and locations.\n","- **`listing_id`**: unique identifier of listing\n","- **`price`**: nightly listing price in USD\n","- **`nbhood_full`**: name of borough and neighborhood where listing is located\n","\n","**data/airbnb_room_type.xlsx**\n","This is an Excel file containing data on Airbnb listing descriptions and room types.\n","- **`listing_id`**: unique identifier of listing\n","- **`description`**: listing description\n","- **`room_type`**: Airbnb has three types of rooms: shared rooms, private rooms, and entire homes/apartments\n","\n","**data/airbnb_last_review.tsv**\n","This is a TSV file containing data on Airbnb host names and review dates.\n","- **`listing_id`**: unique identifier of listing\n","- **`host_name`**: name of listing host\n","- **`last_review`**: date when the listing was last reviewed\n","\n","## Objective\n","\n","As a consultant working for a real estate start-up, you have collected Airbnb listing data from various sources to investigate the short-term rental market in New York. You'll analyze this data to provide insights on private rooms to the real estate company.\n","\n","There are three files in the `data` folder: `airbnb_price.csv`, `airbnb_room_type.xlsx`, `airbnb_last_review.tsv`.\n","\n","- What are the dates of the earliest and most recent reviews? Store these values as two separate variables with your preferred names.\n","\n","- How many of the listings are private rooms? Save this into any variable.\n","\n","- What is the average listing price? Round to the nearest two decimal places and save into a variable.\n","\n","- Combine the new variables into one DataFrame called `review_dates` with four columns in the following order: `first_reviewed`, `last_reviewed`, `nb_private_rooms`, and `avg_price`. The DataFrame should only contain one row of values."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"id":"1fdc5784-479e-46cb-b05b-68439dcc94a7","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":3605,"lastExecutedAt":1724530222482,"lastExecutedByKernel":"6862ecda-74e5-4732-84ad-978bb091d508","lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"#
