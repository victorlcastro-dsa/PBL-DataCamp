# ⚽ Hypothesis Testing with Men's and Women's Soccer Matches

This [notebook](workspace/notebook.ipynb) investigates the hypothesis that more goals are scored in women's international soccer matches compared to men's. By performing a statistical analysis on historical match data, the project aims to provide insights that could inform sports journalism and analysis.

## 📊 Project Description

The project focuses on analyzing the number of goals scored in men's and women's FIFA World Cup matches since January 1, 2002. The analysis is based on datasets containing results from official international matches, allowing for a comprehensive comparison of goal-scoring trends.

The datasets used in this project are:

- `women_results.csv`: Contains results of women's international soccer matches.
- `men_results.csv`: Contains results of men's international soccer matches.

## 🎯 Objective
