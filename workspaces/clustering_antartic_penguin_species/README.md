# 🐧 Clustering Antarctic Penguin Species

This [notebook](workspace/notebook.ipynb) was developed to analyze Antarctic penguin species using clustering techniques. The goal is to identify patterns and distinct characteristics among different penguin species based on physical measurement data.

## 📊 Project Description

Studying Antarctic penguins can provide valuable insights into biodiversity and adaptation to extreme climates. In this project, we apply clustering algorithms to group penguins into species, using features such as beak size, flipper length, and body weight. The analysis aims to assist biologists and ecologists in better understanding the differences and similarities between species.

## 🎯 Objective

The main objectives are:

- Pre-process and clean the penguin data to ensure accurate analysis.
- Use clustering algorithms to identify natural groups of penguins.
- Analyze the results to discover which characteristics are most influential in distinguishing between species.

## 🛠️ Instructions

1. **Data Preparation**: Load and inspect the penguin dataset.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Explore the dataset's features to identify initial patterns.
3. **Clustering**: Apply clustering algorithms to group penguins into species.
4. **Visualization**: Create visualizations to support findings and insights.
