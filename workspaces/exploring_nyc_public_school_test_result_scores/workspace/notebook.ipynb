There are three sections - reading, math, and writing, each with a **maximum score of 800 points**. These tests are extremely important for students and colleges, as they play a pivotal role in the admissions process.\n","\n","Analyzing the performance of schools is important for a variety of stakeholders, including policy and education professionals, researchers, government, and even parents considering which school their children should attend. \n","\n","You have been provided with a dataset called `schools.csv`, which is previewed below.\n","\n","You have been tasked with answering three key questions about New York City (NYC) public school SAT performance.\n","\n","## Objective\n","\n","Which NYC schools have the best math results?\n","\n","- The best math results are at least 80% of the **maximum possible score of 800** for math.\n","\n","- Save your results in a pandas DataFrame called `best_math_schools`, including `\"school_name\"` and `\"average_math\"` columns, sorted by \"average_math\" in descending order.\n","\n","What are the top 10 performing schools based on the combined SAT scores?\n","\n","- Save your results as a pandas DataFrame called `top_10_schools` containing the `\"school_name\"` and a new column named `\"total_SAT\"`, with results ordered by \"total_SAT\" in descending order.\n","\n","Which single borough has the largest standard deviation in the combined SAT score?\n","\n","- Save your results as a pandas DataFrame called `largest_std_dev`.\n","\n","- The DataFrame should contain one row, with:\n","    - `\"borough\"` - the name of the NYC borough with the largest standard deviation of `\"total_SAT\"`.\n","    - `\"num_schools\"` - the number of schools in the borough.\n","    - `\"average_SAT\"` - the mean of `\"total_SAT\"`.\n","    - `\"std_SAT\"` - the standard deviation of `\"total_SAT\"`.\n","\n","- Round all numeric values to two decimal places."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":42,"id":"d0eb4f16-5a99-460d-a5ba-706b7ef0bbe7","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":3646,"id":"bA5ajAmk7XH6","lastExecutedAt":1724567497652,"lastExecutedByKernel":"f3d27735-8acf-4f0f-a6a9-bd5f6ba898d9","lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# Importing library\nimport pandas as pd","outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":196,"type":"dataFrame"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["# Importing library\n","import pandas as pd"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":43,"id":"d06ab813-1b37-49ae-a1cc-9cd90941bc4b","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":86,"lastExecutedAt":1724567507449,"lastExecutedByKernel":"f3d27735-8acf-4f0f-a6a9-bd5f6ba898d9","lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# Read in the data\nschools = pd.read_csv(\"schools.csv\")"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Read in the data\n","schools = pd.read_csv(\"schools.csv\")"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":44,"id":"bec2af2c-3ad3-4b69-ae1b-b32699fd24c5","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":28,"lastExecutedAt":1724567513234,"lastExecutedByKernel":"f3d27735-8acf-4f0f-a6a9-bd5f6ba898d9","lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# Preview the data\nschools.head()"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>school_name</th>\n","      <th>borough</th>\n","      <th>building_code</th>\n","      <th>average_math</th>\n","      <th>average_reading</th>\n","      <th>average_writing</th>\n","      <th>percent_tested</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>New Explorations into Science, Technology and ...</td>\n","      <td>Manhattan</td>\n","      <td>M022</td>\n","      <td>657</td>\n","      <td>601</td>\n","      <td>601</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>Essex Street Academy</td>\n","      <td>Manhattan</td>\n","      <td>M445</td>\n","      <td>395</td>\n","      <td>411</td>\n","      <td>387</td>\n","      <td>78.9</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>Lower Manhattan Arts Academy</td>\n","      <td>Manhattan</td>\n","      <td>M445</td>\n","      <td>418</td>\n","      <td>428</td>\n","      <td>415</td>\n","      <td>65.1</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>High School for Dual Language and Asian Studies</td>\n","      <td>Manhattan</td>\n","      <td>M445</td>\n","      <td>613</td>\n","      <td>453</td>\n","      <td>463</td>\n","      <td>95.9</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>Henry Street School for International Studies</td>\n","      <td>Manhattan</td>\n","      <td>M056</td>\n","      <td>410</td>\n","      <td>406</td>\n","      <td>381</td>\n","      <td>59.7</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>"],"text/plain":["                                         school_name    borough building_code  \\\n","0  New Explorations into Science, Technology and ...
