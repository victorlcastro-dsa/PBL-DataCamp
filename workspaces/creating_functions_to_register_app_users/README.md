# 🛡️ Creating Functions to Register App Users

This [notebook](workspace/notebook.ipynb) is designed to define functions that catch errors during the registration process for a mobile app, ensuring a robust and smooth sign-up experience.

## 📋 Project Description

As a junior developer at a small startup, your task is to enhance the current user sign-up flow by integrating reusable Python functions that validate the inputs provided in the registration form. The goal is to improve the process by approving or rejecting sign-up attempts before account creation, thereby enhancing the onboarding experience for thousands of app users.

## 📊 Dataset

The notebook does not involve external datasets but focuses on creating and testing Python functions for user registration validation.

## 🎯 Objective

The primary objective is to build and integrate validation functions into the sign-up flow, improving the robustness and quality of the user registration process.

## 🏆 Key Functions

- **Username Validation**: Ensures that the username meets length and character requirements.
- **Password Validation**: Checks that passwords are strong and meet complexity standards.
- **Email Validation**: Confirms that the email address follows a valid format.
- **Error Handling**: Implements error handling to provide clear feedback to users during registration.

## 🛠️ Instructions

1. **Function Definition**: Define Python functions to validate user inputs.
2. **Integration**: Integrate these functions into the existing sign-up flow.
3. **Testing**: Test the functions to ensure they correctly approve or reject sign-up attempts.
4. **Deployment**: Deploy the improved sign-up flow in the app.

## 📦 Dependencies

This notebook requires the following libraries:

- 🐍 `Python` (standard libraries only)

## 🚀 Usage

To use this notebook, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter or any other compatible environment.
3. Run the cells sequentially to define and test the validation functions.
4. Integrate the functions into your app's sign-up flow.
